# Lab 4.2 Array Manipulation

## Overview

The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate my ability to: 
- Use array methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() to manipulate arrays.
- Filter and transform arrays using JavaScript array methods.
- Dynamically display the contents of arrays on a webpage.
- Write clean, maintainable JavaScript code to handle array operations.

## Features

This exercise includes these tasks:
Task 1: Array Manipulation Basics
- Create an empty array called shoppingList.
- Write a function called addItem that takes an item as a parameter and adds it to the shoppingList array.
- Write a function called removeLastItem that removes the last item from the shoppingList array.
- Write a function called displayList that logs all items in the shoppingList array to the console.
Task 2: Filter and Search an Array
- Modify the addItem function to only add the item if it is not already in the shoppingList array.
- Write a function called filterItems that takes a search term as a parameter and returns all items in the shoppingList that contain that search term (case-insensitive).
Task 3: Render the List in the Browser
- Create an HTML page with an input field, an “Add Item” button, and an unordered list to display the items.
- Write a JavaScript function that adds items to the array and updates the displayed list dynamically when the button is clicked.
- Write another function that removes the last item and updates the displayed list when a “Remove Last Item” button is clicked.

## Tools

- HTML
- JavaScript

## Reflection Questions
1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
These methods allowed quick and easy manipulation of the array without writing complex functions.
2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
I had some difficulty understanding the syntax necessary to filter the array using the filter and includes methods.
3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
Since the code included several tasks, I found it necessary to do the tasks one by one and then comment out the previous code to understand my progress.  It would be neater if all the code was working for the final product.  I could also make it more user-friendly by adding some accessibility to the html.
